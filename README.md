# A Google Homepage Clone from The Odin Project.

The first project of TOP, it was a good experience to learn more about HTML and CSS.

Things that I learned doing this project:
1. Using max-width 100% and height: auto to make an image responsive.
2. Using grid-templates-columns to make two divs side by side.
