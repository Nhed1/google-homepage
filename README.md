A Google Homepage Clone from The Odin Project. 

-The first project of TOP, it was a good experience to learn more about HTML and CSS.
- Some things that I learned doing this project:
 1- Using max-width 100% and height: auto to make an image responsive.
 2- Using grid-templates-columns to make two divs side by side.
 
- Thins that I need to improve:
- 1- MediaQueries and responsive layout.
